# Cookiecutter TU Wien Jupyter Template

This template is meant for creating Jupyter notebooks for lectures and labs.

# Requirements

This template depends on the [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) framework for generating templated projects.

To load template:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/TUW-GEO/cookiecutter-tuw-jupyter
```

This will prompt three questions:

 - Github Name: Github account name of person or group (defaults to [TUW-GEO](https://github.com/TUW-GEO))
 - Project Name: Name of project and the accompanying GitHub repository
 - Project Slug: The same as the name but without capital letters and spaces
